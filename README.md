```javascript
import { calculatePlan } from '@parcelado_lara/payment-plan-wasm';
const params = {
    maxTotalAmount: Number.MAX_VALUE,
    minInstallmentAmount: 0.0,
    requestedAmount: 8800.0,

    disbursementOnlyOnBusinessDays: false,
}
const result = calculatePlan(params);
```

  - If `startDate` is after `endDate`, an error will be thrown.

### nextDisbursementDate
Calculates the next disbursement date based on a `baseDate`
